This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created with [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), which is performance-npm.

## Getting Started

Make sure that you have PNPM installed in your system, if not, follow [this documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Then, install all the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

When you are ready, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

For this project, I used a Freemiun API from Rapid API, called [The Cocktail DB](https://rapidapi.com/thecocktaildb/api/the-cocktail-db). If you want to play along with the project, you'll need your own API Key.

In the root folder of your project, create a file `.env.local` following the code in the `.env.example` provided.
